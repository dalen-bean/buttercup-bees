					<h2>Shop for bee products.</h2>
					<p>
						We started Buttercup Bees with the thought that we would share our love of bees with everyone and maybe create lotion or chapstick with our beeswax for fun. A few experiments, and million puns later we came up with these!
					</p>
					<p>
						The lotion bars are the bees knees! 😍 they leave your hands, feet and anything else so smooth and hydrated. They’re solid bars so they’re less wasteful and literally melt in your hands as your rub it in.
					</p>
					<p>
						The lip balm helps with chapped, sore lips and is full of natural ingredients. It’s the perfect combination of smooth but firm chapstick.
						After some testing the chapsticks by sending them through the laundry and leaving in the car they’re still solid and smooth!!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’re looking for a few natural, local products, you’ll love these two straight from our hives 🐝 we might even have a few more up our sleeves 😉 send us a message for purchase details or if you’re just curious. We love to chat!
